What is System Design?

Imagine you're building a city. System design is like creating the blueprint for that city. It's about planning how all the different parts of a software system will work together. This includes:

What the system needs to do: (Like, "people need to get from home to work.")
How it will handle lots of people: (Like, "we need roads, buses, and trains.")
How it will store information: (Like, "we need libraries and databases.")
How it will stay working even if something breaks: (Like, "we need backup power and emergency services.")
In simple terms, system design is about making sure a software system can do its job efficiently, reliably, and can grow as needed.

Scalability Basics

Now, let's say your city suddenly gets a lot more residents. Scalability is about how well your city (or software system) can handle that increase. In software, it means:

Being able to handle more users.
Being able to process more data.
Being able to keep working even when things get busy.
Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

There are two main ways to make your system more scalable:

Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):
Think of this as upgrading a single building. Instead of building more houses, you add more floors to an existing apartment building.
In software, this means adding more power to a single server. You might add more RAM, a faster CPU, or more storage.
Pros:
Simpler to implement initially.
Easier to manage.
Cons:
There's a limit to how much you can upgrade a single server. You'll eventually hit a wall.
If that one server fails, the whole system goes down.
Cost can increase exponentially as you add more resources to one machine.
Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):
Think of this as building more houses. Instead of making one building taller, you build more buildings next to it.
In software, this means adding more servers to your system. You distribute the workload across multiple machines.
Pros:
Virtually limitless scalability. You can keep adding servers as needed.
Better fault tolerance. If one server fails, the others can keep working.
Cost can be more efficient, by adding more commodity hardware.
Cons:
More complex to implement. You need to manage multiple servers.
Requires load balancing to distribute traffic.
Data consistency can be more challenging.
In essence:

Vertical scaling: Makes one thing stronger.
Horizontal scaling: Adds more things.
Example:

Imagine a website that sells tickets.
If they use vertical scaling, they might upgrade their main server to handle more traffic.
If they use horizontal scaling, they might add more servers and use a load balancer to distribute the ticket requests.
