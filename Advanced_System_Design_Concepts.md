# Advanced System Design Concepts

## Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to users as one coherent system. These systems distribute workloads across multiple machines to achieve higher performance, reliability, and scalability.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Concurrency** - Components operate simultaneously
2. **Lack of global clock** - Hard to determine exact ordering of events
3. **Independent failures** - Components can fail independently
4. **Heterogeneity** - Different types of hardware, networks, and software

### Distributed System Challenges

#### 1. Network Unreliability

- Network partitions (splits between nodes)
- Packet loss
- Latency spikes
- Limited bandwidth

#### 2. Consistency Models

**Strong Consistency**
- All nodes see the same data at the same time
- Expensive to implement in distributed systems
- Examples: Two-phase commit, Paxos, Raft

**Eventual Consistency**
- All nodes will eventually converge to the same state
- Better performance, less coordination overhead
- Examples: Amazon Dynamo, Cassandra, CouchDB

**Causal Consistency**
- Operations causally related must be seen in the same order by all nodes
- Compromise between strong and eventual consistency

#### 3. Distributed Consensus

Reaching agreement among nodes in a distributed system:

- **Paxos** - Classic consensus algorithm
- **Raft** - Simplified version of Paxos, designed for understandability
- **Zab** - Used in ZooKeeper for coordination
- **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)** - Handles malicious nodes

## System Design Patterns

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevents cascading failures by failing fast and providing fallback mechanisms when a service is unavailable.

**How it works:**
- Monitors for failures
- Trips when failure threshold is reached
- After cooling period, allows test requests

**Example:** Netflix Hystrix implements circuit breakers to prevent system-wide failures when individual services fail.

### 2. Bulkhead Pattern

Isolates components of an application into pools so that if one fails, others continue to function.

**Example:** In a cruise ship, bulkheads divide the hull into watertight compartments to prevent the entire ship from sinking if one section is breached.

### 3. Throttling Pattern

Controls the rate at which users can access a service, preventing overload.

**Implementation methods:**
- Token bucket algorithm
- Leaky bucket algorithm
- Fixed window counter
- Sliding window counter

**Example:** API rate limiting used by GitHub, Twitter, and other platform APIs.

### 4. Saga Pattern

Manages transactions and data consistency across multiple services in a microservices architecture.

**Two approaches:**
- Choreography - Each service publishes events that trigger other services
- Orchestration - Central coordinator directs the transaction steps and compensations

## Advanced Database Concepts

### 1. NoSQL Database Types

#### Document Stores
- Store semi-structured data as documents (often in JSON)
- Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB
- Use cases: Content management, user profiles

#### Key-Value Stores
- Simple data model with keys and values
- Examples: Redis, DynamoDB
- Use cases: Caching, session storage, user preferences

#### Column-Family Stores
- Store data in column families
- Examples: Cassandra, HBase
- Use cases: Time-series data, IoT applications

#### Graph Databases
- Optimize storage and querying of relationships
- Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune
- Use cases: Social networks, recommendation engines

### 2. Database Sharding Strategies

#### Horizontal Sharding Approaches

**Range-Based Sharding**
- Divides data based on ranges of a shard key
- Pros: Simple to implement, efficient range queries
- Cons: Potential for hot spots

**Hash-Based Sharding**
- Uses a hash function on the shard key
- Pros: Even data distribution
- Cons: Range queries become inefficient

**Directory-Based Sharding**
- Maintains a lookup table for shard locations
- Pros: Flexible, can change sharding strategy
- Cons: Lookup table becomes a bottleneck

### 3. Polyglot Persistence

Using different database types for different data models within the same application based on specific requirements.

**Example architecture:**
- Relational DB for transactional data
- Document store for user-generated content
- Graph DB for social connections
- Key-value store for caching

## Real-time Processing Systems

### 1. Stream Processing

Processing continuous streams of data in real-time as they arrive.

**Key concepts:**
- **Windowing** - Processing data in time-based or count-based chunks
- **Watermarks** - Tracking progress of time in stream processing
- **State management** - Maintaining computation state across events

**Popular frameworks:**
- Apache Kafka Streams
- Apache Flink
- Apache Storm
- Apache Samza

### 2. Lambda Architecture

A data-processing architecture designed to handle massive quantities of data by combining batch and stream processing.

**Components:**
- **Batch layer** - Processes historical data in batches
- **Speed layer** - Processes real-time data streams
- **Serving layer** - Combines results for queries

### 3. Kappa Architecture

A simplification of Lambda architecture that processes all data through the streaming layer.

**Advantages:**
- Single code path for processing
- Simpler maintenance
- Consistent processing semantics

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.

**Benefits:**
- Reproducibility
- Version control
- Automated deployment
- Consistency across environments

**Popular tools:**
- Terraform
- AWS CloudFormation
- Ansible
- Pulumi
